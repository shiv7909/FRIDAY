Revolutionize Chat Experience: Gemini pro and Gemini Pro Vision-Powered Chatbot App, Seamlessly Interact with Text and Images for Engaging Conversations

introducing you, my new Flutter project 🫴🏼"FRIDAY"

⚡A dynamic chatbot application that enables users to engage with the Gemini Pro and Gemini Vision APIs by entering their own API keys.

🔑API keys are secured on the local machine using the flutter_secure_storage package. This package utilizes Android's Keystore for encryption, ensuring that sensitive data remains protected.

⚡Users can add or remove the keys at their convenience.

✨I utilized GetX for state management in my app, leveraging its simplicity and efficiency. Additionally, integrating Lottie animations dynamically enhanced the visual appeal and user experience of the application.
